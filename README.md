# Stability-Prediction-Using-ML
1. Built a Support Vector Machine classifier to detect chatter in machining operations and achieved an accuracy of 95%.
2. Successfully implemented Bayesian model in the research paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612520302395?via\%3Dihub) and generated stability lobe diagrams by updating probabilities
3. Successfully implemented the ANN in the research paper (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333694243_Machining_Chatter_Prediction_Using_a_Data_Learning_Model) and achieved an accuracy of 95\% by tuning various hyperparameters.
4. Concluded that Bayesian model is shown to successfully predict stability charts and is effective when size of dataset is small
